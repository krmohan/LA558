<strong>Assignment 20</strong><br>
Krithika Mohan<br><br>

My experience with Mapbox Studio has been quite limited. As my studio projects have been heavily print-based, I have always leaned towards ArcMap to edit data and then export to Illustrator to tweak the colors and stroke. As I progressed through assignments and lectures in this class, I found myself slightly frustrated as I had little control over the basemaps and the look of the web maps I created (when compared to some of the inspirations on the internet). I now understand that Mapbox could be a powerful tool to support leaflet. I especially like how some of the properties can be edited as JSON while creating a map style. That will be fun to experiment with.<br><br>

When I make a styled map in the near future (using Mapbox Studio), I will definitely consider adding tilesets (as SHP or GeoJSON) and edit on MapBox before publishing and exporting to the leaflet map. I am interested in using the Mapbox Satellite Streets Layer as it provides a great base aerial that can be layered with waterways, place labels and roads easily. This would come in handy for my final proposal with Bangladesh floods. Instead of adding a seperate basemap on leaflet for labels, I will be able to save them as a single basemap. The opacity and size of the labels will be reduced as well. Mapbox Studio also gives me an opportunity to add raster imagery as GeoTIFF. I will be able to add 2017 (and other) flood imagery this way for comparison.
